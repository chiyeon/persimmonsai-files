= So, why do we call it Newtonian mechanics?
~ Newtonian mechanics
# Well, let's say you're playing golf on a beautiful sunny day. You hit a golf ball with your club and watch as it sails through the air. Newton's laws of motion come into play here. As you swing the club, you apply force to the ball, which causes it to accelerate and move forward. According to Newton's first law, an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force, such as gravity or a golf hole. The second law tells us that the acceleration of an object depends on its mass and the net force applied to it. Finally, Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, when you hit the ball with your club, the club exerts a force on the ball, causing it to move forward, while at the same time, the ball exerts an equal and opposite force back on the club. This is what we call Newtonian mechanics because it explains the motion of objects using these fundamental laws.

= So what's the difference between gamma rays and beta particles?
~ beta particle
# Well, let me explain it to you. Gamma rays are actually not considered as radiation because they don't interact much with matter. It's like a car going at high speed without any obstacles on its way. But when there's an obstacle in the form of electrons or other atoms, beta particles are more likely to encounter them and get absorbed.

= Hey, what's diffraction?\nTUTOR: Well... let's say you are trying to get to school from home. \n= I walk along a straight road that is blocked by a tree. \nTUTOR: If you take a left turn and then another left, it seems as if the road has magically appeared on the other side of the tree.

~ nuclear physics
# Sure, what do you need help with?

= Can you explain to me what scalar means?
~ scalar
# Sure thing! Scalars are just regular numbers without any fancy directions or anything. Like, 5 is a scalar because it doesn't have any arrows or anything. Got it?

= What is a black body?
~ black body
# Ah, a black body. That's when an object absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and re-emits it at a certain wavelength. It was first introduced by Sir Isaac Newton but later redefined as an object that perfectly reflects or emits light of any given wavelength without any absorption. You can also think of it like a hot plate - it gets hotter and hotter until it starts to emit more infrared light, which is the black body radiation. But don't get too confused with the term "black hole".

= What do you mean by conservation of momentum?
~ conservation of momentum
# You know how we talked about velocity, acceleration, and forces before? Well, that's all related to this principle. It means that if you have a system where objects are interacting with each other, the total momentum of that system doesn't change. Just like when you're walking on a crowded street - even though people are pushing and shoving, your overall velocity is still constant because the forces cancel out in opposite directions.

= Can you explain what solid-state physics is?

# Well, first we need to understand what it is. It's like when you go on vacation, but instead of packing your bags and heading out the door, we're going to be breaking down the equation into smaller parts so that we can better understand how it works.

= Why do we need to learn about scalars?
~ scalar
# Well, I guess you could say that scalars are like those things in your life that have just numbers attached to them and can be easily measured, but they don't really add anything else to the equation. Like how much money is in your wallet or the length of a pencil. They may not seem important, but when you're trying to figure out something bigger like distance between two points, you need scalars to get there.

~ focal length
# Focal length is the distance to the point where parallel rays of light meet after passing through an optical system or reflecting off a surface, as long as that surface has a constant refractive index and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. In simple terms, it's how far away your eye will be from the object in order for you to see it clearly on the other side of a lens.

= I was wondering if you could explain to me what thermal radiation means?
~ thermal radiation
# Oh, that's an interesting question. Thermal radiation is just another word for heat transfer. When energy moves from a hot object to a cooler one without any movement of matter between them, it's called thermal radiation.

~ mechanical filter
# Yes, that’s correct. But when we talk about mechanical filters in physics, they are used to separate particles based on their size. These filters can be made of different materials and have various applications in different fields such as industrial processes and medical procedures.

~ phosphorescence
# The word 'fluorescence' is used for materials that absorb light at one wavelength and then emit light at a different wavelength, which is generally shorter than the absorbed light's frequency. So, fluorescence happens instantaneously after the absorption of the incident light. On the other hand, when a material absorbs photons and gets excited to higher energy levels, it releases these excitation electrons back into the ground state through non-radiative processes such as collisions with surrounding atoms or molecules, resulting in very low intensity emission over long periods. This process is called phosphorescence. The light emitted during this process has much longer wavelength and lower frequency than the absorbed light, hence its name - phosphorescence!
