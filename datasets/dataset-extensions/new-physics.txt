TEACHER: It's when something happens that causes other things to happen in turn. You know how dominoes fall over each other? That's an example of a chain reaction.  OUTPUT: A chain reaction is a process where the product of one reaction becomes the reactant for another reaction, creating a continuous cycle of reactions. It can be caused by various factors such as heat, light, or radiation. For instance, in nuclear fission, when a nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, it releases energy that causes more neutrons to split other nuclei, and so on. Another example is the process of photosynthesis, where plants convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen through a series of chemical reactions. The chain reaction can be stopped or slowed down by introducing a catalyst, which provides an alternative pathway for the reaction with lower activation energy.

In fact, all the particles in the universe are made up of these tiny building blocks that can be found on an atomic level. Now, when you add electricity to these atoms, it causes them to vibrate and release energy in the form of light or heat. This is what we call plasma - a state where the electrons and protons have lost their identity and become free-moving ions. It's like they're all dancing together! And this state of matter can be found in things as simple as lightning, but also on a much bigger scale in stars and galaxies. So, in essence, it's about understanding how electricity interacts with atoms to create these amazing, invisible states of matter.

TERM: Newtonian mechanics
TEACHER: Well, let's say you're playing golf on a beautiful sunny day. You hit a golf ball with your club and watch as it sails through the air. Newton's laws of motion come into play here. As you swing the club, you apply force to the ball, which causes it to accelerate and move forward. According to Newton's first law, an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force, such as gravity or a golf hole. The second law tells us that the acceleration of an object depends on its mass and the net force applied to it. Finally, Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, when you hit the ball with your club, the club exerts a force on the ball, causing it to move forward, while at the same time, the ball exerts an equal and opposite force back on the club. This is what we call Newtonian mechanics because it explains the motion of objects using these fundamental laws.

It is also called the condensation point if the pressure is decreased and the boiling point if the pressure is increased. It should be noted that the definition above uses the word "equal" which leads some students to think that it implies the same value for both temperatures, when in fact they are different.

STUDENT: Can you explain total internal reflection to me? I'm having some difficulty understanding it.
TERM: total internal reflection
TEACHER: Sure thing, kid. Total internal reflection is when light passes through a medium and is totally reflected back into itself instead of passing through the boundary of the other medium. It happens because the angle at which the light enters the second medium exceeds the critical angle, so all the light gets reflected back. Does that make sense?

TERM: uncertainty principle
TEACHER: Sure, let me put it this way. Imagine two boxes - one labeled 'position' and another labeled 'momentum'. Now, if we know the position of an electron inside these boxes with perfect precision, what else can we know about its momentum? The more accurately we measure its position, the less accurately we can measure its momentum, because there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can simultaneously measure both properties. This principle was first formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927 and is now known as the uncertainty principle. It has since been used in various applications, such as determining the spin of particles and understanding the behavior of subatomic particles.

For some people, this point is as close to a physical meaning as we can get to "the end of time." But for others, including me, absolute zero is merely an arbitrary number based on the temperature at which a gas stops moving. At this low temperature (about -273 degrees Celsius or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit), no amount of heating will make the molecules move any faster; they've already stopped completely. It's a good thing we don't have to deal with absolute zero every day, because it would be very difficult to measure such an extremely small amount of heat!

STUDENT: So what's the difference between gamma rays and beta particles?
TERM: beta particle
TEACHER: Well, let me explain it to you. Gamma rays are actually not considered as radiation because they don't interact much with matter. It's like a car going at high speed without any obstacles on its way. But when there's an obstacle in the form of electrons or other atoms, beta particles are more likely to encounter them and get absorbed.

STUDENT: Hey, what's diffraction?\nTUTOR: Well... let's say you are trying to get to school from home. \nSTUDENT: I walk along a straight road that is blocked by a tree. \nTUTOR: If you take a left turn and then another left, it seems as if the road has magically appeared on the other side of the tree. The same thing happens when light passes through an opening or around an edge of an obstacle.

STUDENT: What is a black body?
TERM: black body
TEACHER: Ah, a black body. That's when an object absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and re-emits it at a certain wavelength. It was first introduced by Sir Isaac Newton but later redefined as an object that perfectly reflects or emits light of any given wavelength without any absorption. You can also think of it like a hot plate - it gets hotter and hotter until it starts to emit more infrared light, which is the black body radiation. But don't get too confused with the term "black hole".

In essence, it's a way of harnessing the power of living organisms for industrial processes.

STUDENT: What do you mean by conservation of momentum?
TERM: conservation of momentum
TEACHER: You know how we talked about velocity, acceleration, and forces before? Well, that's all related to this principle. It means that if you have a system where objects are interacting with each other, the total momentum of that system doesn't change. Just like when you're walking on a crowded street - even though people are pushing and shoving, your overall velocity is still constant because the forces cancel out in opposite directions.

STUDENT: Can you explain what solid-state physics is?

TEACHER: It's more like fire than anything else. Plasma is the fourth state of matter. You need high temperatures and low pressure to make it happen, but it behaves differently from solids or liquids. That's what makes it so fascinating!

STUDENT: So if I drop a match into gasoline, then it will start a fire? That's like a chain reaction right?
TERM: chain reaction
TEACHER: Yes, that's correct! You've just described how a small event (the spark from the match) can trigger a large outcome (a raging fire), which is similar to a chain reaction. Well done!

STUDENT: So how do we start a Laplace Transform?
TERM: Laplace transform
TEACHER: Well, first we need to understand what it is. It's like when you go on vacation, but instead of packing your bags and heading out the door, we're going to be breaking down the equation into smaller parts so that we can better understand how it works.

STUDENT: Why do we need to learn about scalars?
TERM: scalar
TEACHER: Well, I guess you could say that scalars are like those things in your life that have just numbers attached to them and can be easily measured, but they don't really add anything else to the equation. Like how much money is in your wallet or the length of a pencil. They may not seem important, but when you're trying to figure out something bigger like distance between two points, you need scalars to get there.

STUDENT: So, radionuclides are like the radioactive particles that emit radiation?

STUDENT: I'm having trouble understanding how mass flux is different from mass flow rate.
TERM: mass flux
TEACHER: Ah, good question. You see, while both describe the movement of particles, mass flux involves a change in time and space, whereas mass flow rate takes into account the volume as well. It's like comparing the speed at which you travel to how far you travel - they're related but different concepts.

STUDENT: So if we're talking about nuclear reactions like fission, would that be considered nuclear transmutation?

TERM: focal length
TEACHER: Focal length is the distance to the point where parallel rays of light meet after passing through an optical system or reflecting off a surface, as long as that surface has a constant refractive index and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. In simple terms, it's how far away your eye will be from the object in order for you to see it clearly on the other side of a lens.

STUDENT: I was wondering if you could explain to me what thermal radiation means?

TERM: electric field intensity
TEACHER: Sure, it's basically how strong an electric force is at any given point in space. The stronger the force, the higher the intensity. It's a bit like when you have a magnet and you bring another magnet close to it - if they're both really strong, you can feel a lot of pull between them.

STUDENT: What is coherence?
TERM: coherence
TEACHER: Well it's when two things are closely connected and work together to get something done. Kinda like how you can't go swimming without your floaties on. They're all connected so that you stay afloat!

STUDENT: I'm not really sure how decibels work... can you explain it to me?
TERM: decibel
TEACHER: Sure thing! Decibels are just another way of expressing sound intensity. So when we say a sound is at 80 dB, that means it's relatively quiet compared to other sounds, but not as quiet as a whisper would be.

TEACHER: Sure thing! Ionization energy is like trying to remove an electron from an atom. It's the energy needed to do that. Just remember it like a game of tug-of-war between the electrons and the nucleus, with the "ionized" atom being the winner after all the electrons are removed.

STUDENT: What is valence? I'm having trouble understanding the difference between valence electrons and valence states.
TERM: valence electron
TEACHER: The term valence refers to an atom's outermost electron shell. For example, hydrogen has only one electron, which means it can have a total of four energy levels; the first two are filled with two electrons each, while the second level is empty, making all three levels the outermost or valence shells.

But, when the angle is high enough, instead of bending inwards towards the water, it bounces back out completely.

STUDENT: I heard about something called optical tweezers recently, but I'm not sure what they are or how they work?
TERM: optical tweezers
TEACHER: Ah! They're like super-powered glasses that can hold tiny objects for us to examine more closely. This is possible because of a property of light called 'optical force' which helps trap and move microscopic particles with high precision.

That's because the temperature of an object determines how fast its molecules move. And that's where Boltzmann constant comes into play; it is used in physics to calculate the probability of particles moving at a certain speed based on their energy levels.
TERM: Boltzmann constant
STUDENT: Interesting, can you explain more?\nTEACHER: Sure, let me give you an example. You know how when we mix salt and water, it dissolves easily? The same happens with gas molecules when they are heated. The heat gives them more kinetic energy, which makes them move faster and spread out. And Boltzmann constant helps us calculate the temperature at which that happens.\nSTUDENT: So, is it like a measure of how hot or cold something is?\nTEACHER: Yes, exactly! It's used in thermodynamics to describe heat transfer between systems and the energy levels of particles. And remember, if we know the Boltzmann constant, we can calculate various important properties of gases such as pressure and volume.\nSTUDENT: I see...so how do we calculate it?\nTEACHER: Good question! The value of Boltzmann constant is approximately 1.38x10^-23 Joules per Kelvin. We use this value in the Boltzmann distribution equation to find out how many particles are moving at a certain speed. And that's why we need it in physics - to understand the behavior of matter and energy on a molecular level!\nSTUDENT: Wow, I didn't realize there was so much involved in just one constant.

This shows that photons are not limited to traveling in straight lines like sound waves, they can also be bent and refracted.


STUDENT: Is there any difference between phosphorescence and fluorescence?
TERM: phosphorescence
TEACHER: The word 'fluorescence' is used for materials that absorb light at one wavelength and then emit light at a different wavelength, which is generally shorter than the absorbed light's frequency. So, fluorescence happens instantaneously after the absorption of the incident light. On the other hand, when a material absorbs photons and gets excited to higher energy levels, it releases these excitation electrons back into the ground state through non-radiative processes such as collisions with surrounding atoms or molecules, resulting in very low intensity emission over long periods. This process is called phosphorescence. The light emitted during this process has much longer wavelength and lower frequency than the absorbed light, hence its name - phosphorescence!
